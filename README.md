# Machine Learning course project - NASA: Asteroids Classification

### This project was written as part of the 'Machine Learning' Course at the Jerusalem College of Engineering.

We were asked to pick interesting data, analyze it, learn about it by using different learning algorithms, different parameters and compare the different results which were obtained. We chose data that was unbalanced in terms of the Y column (more False values than True values), Therefore we had to deal with several obstacles, including balancing the data, finding the most relevant features, and considering various measures.
We divided this work into several parts: at first, we compared several different learning algorithms without changing the parameters. Then, we compared the 2 algorithms that gave the best results for the measures we chose, using different alphas, and finally, we tested different parameters for the algorithm that gave us the best results for the data.

The algorithms we used in this project:
Balance the data:
1. SMOTE (Upscaling)
2. Near Miss (Downscaling)

Learning Algorithms:
1. Logistic Regression (LR)
2. Support Vector Clustering (SVC)
3. K Neighbors Classifier
4. Gaussian Naive Bayes

Measures:
1. Accuracy
2. Precision
3. Recall
4. AUC
